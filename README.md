# Dynamic Credit Spread Regime Modeling and Macro Shock Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes the behavior of corporate bond credit spreads over time using real-world economic indicators. It applies machine learning (Gaussian Mixture Models) to identify hidden economic regimes and studies how macroeconomic factors affect credit spreads in different market conditions. A GDP stress simulation is also conducted to evaluate spread sensitivity under crisis scenarios.

## ðŸ“Š Objectives

- Calculate historical credit spreads between corporate and treasury bonds.
- Identify hidden market regimes (Crisis vs Calm) using Gaussian Mixture Models.
- Perform regression analysis of macroeconomic drivers (CPI, GDP, Unemployment, Fed Funds) on credit spreads.
- Compare macro impact in each regime separately.
- Simulate spread behavior under a hypothetical 2% GDP drop (stress testing).

## ðŸ§  Key Techniques Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (sklearn)
- Statsmodels for OLS regression
- Real financial datasets from FRED
- Stress scenario simulation
